## This-Is-Streamify
Three young aspiring Software Engineers tackle Project 2 by reverse-engineering the well-known music application known as Spotify.
This-Is-Streamify.

## Getting Started

1. https://github.com/brendonvan/This-Is-Spotify
2. https://this-is-streamify.herokuapp.com/

 ## User Stories

User navigates to the site and interacts by searching for tracks to listen to, hitting the Like button to add them to a Liked tracks playlist, and create, update, and delete playlists. Users will enjoy a great interface as he/she can search for any track thanks to the Spotify API.

Three key features for our MVP:
1. Search for any track using Spotify's API
2. Creating and storing playlists
3. Ability to Like tracks and add them to a Liked playlist

## User Flow
One improvement to our design is that we made it 1-click faster to add and delete tracks and playlists.
Another improvement to our design is that we wish we could have added User Authentication.
Another big improvement we wanted to add was the ability to play tracks. It would have been really fun to be able to imitate Spotify accurately.
Another implementation that we did not get to was the utilization of Sass. We tried getting Sass to work for a 404 GIF, but ran out of time.
Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to incorporate everything that we wanted to.

## Database Models/ERDs

Database Models:

1. Playlist model
2. Tracks model
3. User model

ERDs:

User to Playlists: One to Many relationship
Playlists to Tracks: Many to Many relationship

---
## Full CRUD

Our project features full CRUD (create, read, update and destroy).
Create: we are able to create playlists.
Read: we are able to show the playlists, search bar, search tracks, and things of that nature.
Update: we are able to update our playlists by adding them, removing them, or liking them.
Destroy: we are able to fully delete playlists or delete songs out of playlists.

## Summary

Brendon: I enjoyed the challenge of implementing the Spotify API, and everything that came along with it. It took us a few days to get it running, but it was satisfying once we were able to search for any song we wanted.

Kevin: I enjoyed getting a better understanding of routes and working with my teammates, which has been enjoyable and satisfying. Working in a group is very different from tackling a solo project, so it was great to experience a different dynamic.
